# Introduction

### Needed Fourmulas:
* y(t)=-1/2gt^2 +v0 t+y0
* v(t) = -g t + v0.
, where g = 32 feet/sec2 = 9.8 meters/sec2


### Example1
a) Use Mathematica to plot a graph of the height function, y(t), and from this graph approximate the maximum height that the stone reaches and the time at which thestone
reaches its maximum height.
b) Use Mathematica to approximate the times at which the stone is at a height of 600 feet.

Note that once we have utilized Mathematica to generate the graph of a curve, or a set of curves, in two dimensions, we can further use Mathematica to approximate the location of any point in the resulting graphics. This is done as follows:
1) Move the pointer so that it lies over the graphics cell from which you wish to approximate the location of the desired point, and click once with the left mouse button on this cell. A rectangular frame will appear around this cell. At this point it would be good to enlarge the cell by clicking on and then dragging one of the small black squares that lie on the cell frame to a new position. This will increase the resolution of any curves in the graphics cell, and should make it so that we can obtain better accuracy in finding the coordinates of the desired point.
2) While holding down both the Control and the Alt keys (the key or keys that may need to be pressed may vary according to the system being used--the Macintosh utilizes the Command key and Windows utilizes the Control key), center the pointer (which now looks like a large plus sign, "+", with a hole in its center) at the location of the point on the graph whose coordinates you wish to approximate. (Note that while moving the pointer around in the frame, the coordinates of any point that the center of the pointer passes over will appear on the left-hand side of the status bar at the bottom of the notebook window.) Click once on this location with the left mouse button. This will leave an additional point at this location, although it may not be visible due to the graphics of the curve itself. This point will be the point whose coordinates we shall next retrieve--the point whose coordinates will serve as an approximation to the coordinates of the point that we wish to find. Now release the Control and Alt keys.
3) Move the pointer to the Edit menu and click once with the left mouse button, and after the Edit menu drops down, select the Copy option by clicking once on it.
4) Move the pointer to the location on the notebook where you wish to insert the values of the coordinates of the point as text, and click once on this location with the left mouse button. Note that this must be a place where text can be inserted.
5) Move the pointer to the Edit menu and click once with the left mouse button. After the Edit menu drops down, select the Paste option by clicking once on it. The coordinates of the point should then appear at the desired location in the notebook.
If we modify step (2) so that we click on several points, then the result of step (5) will be modified in that the coordinates of each point that we select will appear in the notebook.
