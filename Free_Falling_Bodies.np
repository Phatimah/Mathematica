# Introduction



### Needed Functions
a(t) = -g
v(t) = -g t + v0
y(t)=-1/2gt2 +v0 t+y0
y(t) = h.


### Example1
A coin is dropped from the top of a building that is 1000 feet in height.
a) Compute its height after 1 sec, 2 sec, 3 sec, and 4 sec.
b) At what time will the coin hit the ground?
* Remember that the coin hits the ground when y(t) = 0.
c) What is the velocity of the coin right before impact?
* Remember that the velocity of the coin right before impact is the velocity at the time in which the coin hits the ground.

### Example2
A stone is tossed upward at an initial velocity of 120 feet/sec from the edge of a cliff that drops down 500 feet to the sea below.
a) At what time and at what height will the stone reach its maximum height?
* Remember that the stone reaches its maximum height at the time in which velocity =0. 
* Remember that the stone maximum height will be at the instant in which velocity =0. 
b) At what time will the stone be at a height of 550 feet?
c) At what time and at what velocity will the stone hit the surf below?

### Example3
A ball is tossed upward from the ground at a rate of 200 feet/sec, while at the same moment a man is climbing a ladder at a rate 
of 5 feet/sec starting from a height of 100 feet. At what time will the man and the ball be at the same height, and at what height will 
this occur?

Solution: 
We can implement Mathematica to find the values of t and y that satisfy both equations
simultaneously with the command in the link below:
